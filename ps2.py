#Problem 2!
#Had to find and read online but the answer I found helped me with the
#the rest of the problem set:
#For this type of problem,
#if you can find a string of sequential numbers that is
#as long as the smallest counting unit then you can count
    
#to any subsequent number by adding this smallest counting unit
#a member of this base sequential series. Wow.

#endnote: is this the cleanest solution?: No
# is it the solution MIT wanted?: Definitely not
# is it really ugly?: Yep!
#but this was made by me. The only help I had was a bit of StackOverflow and whatever
#messed up logic I had in my head.
#I'll probably look back on this mess in a while and laugh
#hopefully at that point I'll be able to redo this in a cleaner solution
#also doing this instead of UBC application lol
